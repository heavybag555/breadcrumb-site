# Fonts Directory

Place your font files in this directory. The following font files are expected:

- `SFProText-Regular.woff2` (or `.woff`, `.otf`)
- `SFProText-Medium.woff2` (or `.woff`, `.otf`)

The CSS in `app/globals.css` is configured to load these fonts. If you have different font files, update the `@font-face` declarations in `app/globals.css` accordingly.

Supported formats:
- `.woff2` (preferred)
- `.woff`
- `.otf`
- `.ttf`
